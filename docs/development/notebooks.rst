Notebooks
=========

Notebooks are available at:

`Notebooks Repository <https://github.com/aodn/aodn_cloud_optimised/tree/main/notebooks>`_

When creating a new dataset, it is recommended to use the provided template ``notebooks/template.ipynb`` to create a new
notebook. This notebook should be then added to the AWS OpenData registry configuration.

The notebooks can be directly imported into Google Colab:
