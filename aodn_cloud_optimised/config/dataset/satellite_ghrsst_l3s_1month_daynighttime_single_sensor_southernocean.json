    "Name": "Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Single sensor - 1 month - Day and night time - Southern Ocean",
    "Description": "This is a single-sensor SSTfnd product for a one month period, derived using observations from AVHRR instruments on all available NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the Southern Ocean region 3\u00b0E to 158\u00b0W, 27\u00b0S to 78\u00b0S. Each grid cell contains the one month average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the SSTskin observations after rejecting observations with low surface wind speeds (<6m/s by day and <2m/s at night) (see http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2011/beggs.pdf). Matchups with buoy SSTfnd observations for the central date indicate typical 2014 biases of < 0.03 degC and standard deviations of 0.6 degC.  Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information.\n\nProduction of this single sensor product ceased in June 2025, due to decommissioning of the NOAA-18 satellite. Please refer to the following multi sensor product for data after June 2025 - IMOS - Satellite Remote Sensing - SST - L3S - Multi Sensor - 1 month - day and night time - Southern Ocean (https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/579fc1ac-6ee5-40e2-9170-6a857e9b40da).",
