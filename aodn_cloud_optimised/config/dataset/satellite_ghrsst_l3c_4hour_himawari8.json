    "Name": "Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Single sensor - Himawari-8 - 4 hour",
    "Description": "This is a regional GHRSST level 3 collated (L3C) dataset on 0.02-degree rectangular grid over the Australasian domain (70E to 190E, 70S to 20N) based on retrievals from the AHI imager on board Himawari-8 satellite. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) produces Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) satellite SST products in the International Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) GDS2 file formats for Himawari-8 in real time and delayed mode. This product is composed of reprocessed multi-swath SSTskin retrievals obtained from compositing IMOS Himawari-8 hourly L3C files over the night (before dawn).  \n\n\nEvery 10 minutes, the Himawari-8 full disk is processed to retrieve SSTs by using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTTOV12.3) and Bayesian cloud clearing method based on the ESA CCI SST code developed at the University of Reading. The hourly product on the native grid is then produced by compositing over multiple swaths for the previous 1 hour by selecting the highest quality data with priority given to the value closest in time to the product nominal hour. L3C-04hour SSTs are the latest 4-hour pixels with the highest quality taken from the hourly SST product. The L3C-04hour product on native grid is then remapped over the 0.02-degree IMOS grid to compose the IMOS L3C-04hour product (Govekar et al., 2021,  https://www.foo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Govekar_FOO_2021.pdf). The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2.",
