The analysis flag indicates high difference from analysis temperatures (differences greater than Analysis Limit). The lowwind flag indicates regions of low wind speed (typically less than the low Wind Limit) per NWP model. The highwind flag indicates regions of high wind speed (typically greater than the high Wind Limit) per NWP model. Other flags may be populated and are for internal use and the definitions may change, so should not be relied on. Use flag_meanings to confirm the flag assignment that can be relied on. Flags greater than 64 only apply to non-land pixels.",

    "Description": "This is a regional GHRSST level 3 collated (L3C) dataset on 0.02-degree rectangular grid over the Australasian domain (70E to 190E, 70S to 20N) based on retrievals from the AHI imager on board Himawari-8 satellite. The Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) produces Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) satellite SST products in the International Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) GDS2 file formats for Himawari-8 in real time and delayed mode. This product is composed of reprocessed multi-swath SSTskin retrievals obtained from compositing IMOS Himawari-8 hourly L3C files over the night (before dawn).  \nEvery 10 minutes, the Himawari-8 full disk is processed to retrieve SSTs by using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTTOV12.3) and Bayesian cloud clearing method based on the ESA CCI SST code developed at the University of Reading. The hourly product on native grid is then produced by compositing over multiple swaths for the previous 1 hour. Further, L3C-01day SST fields on native grid are obtained by selecting the highest quality data from the hourly SST records with priority being given to the value the closest in time to the product nominal hour.  The L3C-1day night product on native grid is then remapped over the 0.02-degree IMOS grid to compose IMOS L3C-1day night product (Govekar et al., 2021,  https://www.foo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Govekar_FOO_2021.pdf).   The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2.",
